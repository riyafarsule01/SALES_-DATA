# TASK 3 : DASHBOARD DESIGN OF SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 


### **Goal** ðŸŽ¯

The primary goal was to transform the raw `sales_data.csv` file into a dynamic and interactive ** Power BI ** dashboard. This tool is intended to provide business stakeholders with a clear, at-a-glance understanding of sales performance, identify key trends, and enable self-service data exploration to support strategic decision-making.

### **Outcomes** ðŸ“Š

By creating various charts and KPIs, we achieved the following outcomes:

* **Performance Measurement**: We established key performance indicators (**KPI Cards**) for **Total Sales**, **Total Items Sold**, and **Number of Orders**. This provides an immediate, high-level summary of business activity.
* **Trend Identification**: The **Time-Series Line Chart** visualizes sales performance over time (2003-2005). This allows stakeholders to easily spot seasonal patterns (like holiday sales spikes), measure growth, and understand the overall health of the business year-over-year.
* **Product Portfolio Analysis**: The **Bar Chart** showing sales by `PRODUCTLINE` clearly identifies top-performing categories and those that are underperforming. This helps in making decisions related to inventory, marketing focus, and product development.
* **Interactive Data Exploration**: The implementation of **Slicers** for `YEAR_ID` and `COUNTRY` empowers users to filter the entire dashboard. This transforms the report from a static document into an interactive tool, allowing anyone to ask and answer specific questions (e.g., "How did 'Classic Cars' perform in 'France' in '2004'?").

### **Conclusion** ðŸ’¡

Based on the analysis of the charts created from this dataset, we can draw several key conclusions:

1.  **"Classic Cars" is the Core Revenue Driver**: The bar chart consistently shows that the **"Classic Cars"** product line generates the most sales revenue, making it the most critical category for the business.
2.  **Significant Seasonal Peaks Exist**: The time-series chart reveals a recurring and significant spike in sales during the fourth quarter (October-November) of each year. This indicates a strong holiday shopping season that is crucial for annual performance and should be a primary focus for marketing and inventory planning.
3.  **The USA is the Dominant Market**: When filtering by country, the data consistently shows that the **USA** is the largest market by a significant margin, representing the most important geographical region for sales.
4.  **The Business Experienced Growth but Stalled**: The sales data shows strong performance in 2003 and 2004. However, the data for 2005 is incomplete, only showing sales for the first five months. This abrupt end suggests that any analysis of 2005 performance must be treated with caution, as it does not represent a full year of business activity.
